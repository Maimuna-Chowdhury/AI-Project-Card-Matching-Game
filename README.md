# AI Project - Card Matching Game

## Description
This simple game is developed using Python programming language. In this game, the player sees a board of cards turned backside. The player has to pick 2 matching cards to score.

The game features an **AI opponent** that uses:
- **Genetic Algorithm**
- **Heuristic Search**

These AI approaches ensure that the game becomes **progressively challenging** at each level. Players have a limit of **24 card clicks** per level before progressing to the next one.
